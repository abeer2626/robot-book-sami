# Capstone Project Guidelines

Welcome to the capstone project portion of Module 5! This document provides comprehensive guidelines to help you successfully complete your robotics project.

## Project Overview

The capstone project is your opportunity to demonstrate mastery of the concepts and skills learned throughout this textbook. You'll design, implement, and document a complete robotic system that addresses a real-world problem or explores an innovative solution.

## Project Requirements

### Technical Requirements

Your project must include:

1. **Hardware/Software Integration**: Combine physical components with software systems
2. **AI/ML Components**: Incorporate at least one AI or machine learning element
3. **Documentation**: Comprehensive technical documentation
4. **Testing**: Verification and validation of system functionality
5. **Presentation**: Clear demonstration of your work

### Scope Guidelines

**Appropriate Scope:**
- Focus on a well-defined problem
- Implement a complete, working solution
- Demonstrate integration of multiple technologies
- Include thoughtful analysis and evaluation

**Avoid These Pitfalls:**
- Overly ambitious projects that cannot be completed
- Simple implementations that don't demonstrate mastery
- Lack of integration between components
- Insufficient testing and documentation

### Phase 3: Implementation (Weeks 4-6)
- **Development Setup**: Environment and tools
- **Core Implementation**: Build the main functionality
- **Integration**: Combine components
- **Iterative Development**: Build, test, repeat

### Phase 4: Testing & Refinement (Weeks 7-8)
- **Unit Testing**: Test individual components
- **Integration Testing**: Test combined systems
- **Performance Testing**: Evaluate efficiency and reliability
- **User Testing**: Get feedback on usability
- **Refinement**: Improve based on feedback

### Phase 5: Documentation & Presentation (Weeks 9-10)
- **Technical Documentation**: Code, architecture, setup
- **User Documentation**: Instructions and guides
- **Final Demonstration**: Prepare for presentation
- **Reflection**: Lessons learned and future improvements
