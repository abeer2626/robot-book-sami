## 💻 Live Code Examples

```python title="Python: Basic Robot Movement"
import robot_library as rl

def move_forward(robot, distance):
    """Move robot forward by specified distance"""
    robot.move(distance, direction="forward")
    return robot.get_position()

# Example usage
my_robot = rl.Robot()
current_pos = move_forward(my_robot, 10)
print(f"Robot moved to position: {current_pos}")
```

```javascript title="JavaScript: AI Decision Making"
function makeDecision(sensorData) {
  // Process sensor data and make intelligent decision
  const processedData = preprocess(sensorData);
  const decision = aiModel.predict(processedData);

  return {
    action: decision.action,
    confidence: decision.confidence,
    reasoning: decision.explanation
  };
}
```
